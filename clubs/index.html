		Queen's Mostly Autonomous Saiboat Team (MAST) 2015-2017
		</h3>
		<p></p>
		<div class="half">
			<p> MAST is a student-run design team that, as the name suggests, builds mostly autonomous sailboats for competition. </p>
			<p>I was a co-manager of the software team, the group that writes code to control the boat. Most of the existing code was written by a student a couple years ago, so I got pretty good at navigating poorly styled and documented code.</p>
