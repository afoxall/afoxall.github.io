title: Clubs
summary: Besides great academics, Queen's boasts an impressive array of clubs and organizations for students to apply and sharpen the skills they learn in the classroom. Here are the ones I have been a part of.

	<div id="QTMA" style="display:none;">
			<p> QTMA is a product management club that helps students experience real tech projects in an entrepreneurial environemnt. I am a senior developer, which means I will lead the development of one of the projects - an online journal which will use NLP to analyze and track users' mental state.</p>

		<div id="EngLinks" style="display:none;">
				<p> EngLinks is a student-run tutoring service at Queen's Engineering. I love to teach, whether it is tutoring, TAing, or just helping classmates. I tutor several courses including data structures, discrete math and differential equations.</p>

		<p><button type="button" id="MAST_arrow" class="arrow-button" onclick="expand_collapse('MAST');">&#9660</button><span style="font-size:115%;"><b> Queen's Mostly Autonomous Saiboat Team </b></span>
		<div id="MAST" style="display:none;">
		MAST is a student-run design team that, as the name suggests, builds mostly autonomous sailboats for competition. </p>
			<p>I was part of MAST for my first, second and third years. In my third year I was a co-manager of the software team, the group that writes code to control the boat. Most of the existing code was written by a student a couple years ago, so I got pretty good at navigating poorly styled and documented code.</p>
