	<div id="4th" style="display:none;">
		<p>In my final year I'm done with core courses, leaving me with room to take some more interesting courses. These include Data Mining, Programming Language Paradigms, Game Architecture, Compilers, and Software requirements. I may also try to take some graduate courses, but that schedule hasn't been released yet.</p>
		<div>
		<h4>Capstone Project</h4><p>
		My final project will be done in partnership with a startup from the Queen's Masters of Entrepreneurship and Innovation. Our partners have obtained the rights to new eye-tracking technology which allows for the diagnosis of many neurological disorders, so my team will be building the platform that will wrap the techonology and make it accessible to physicians.</p></div>

	 <p><button type="button" id="3rd_arrow" class="arrow-button" onclick="expand_collapse('3rd');">&#9654</button><span style="font-size:115%;"><b> Third Year</b></span>
	<div id="3rd" style="display:none;"><p>Third year was much more technically focused than second year, with much more programming. </p>
					
		<div>	
		<h4>Fundamentals of Software Development</h4><p>
		This course, taught in C++, aims to prepare engineers for real-world software development and includes a major term-long project component. I was the manager for my project team, so I was responsible for making sure work gets done on time and to a certain standard. One big challenge was coordinating a mixed team of ECE and CS, most of whom were new to agile and tools like git.   	</p>		 
		</div>	
		
		<div>
		<h4>Neural and Genetic Computing</h4><p>
		This course covered the basics of neural nets and genetic algorithms for machine learning. It involved programming assignments, which I did Python, and a group project. My project involved using recurrent neural nets for sentiment analysis.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
		<h4>Databases</h4><p>
			Relational algebra, schema design, and implementation details culminating in the creation of a php web application. My group developed and deployed a relatively complex social recipe site. </p>
		</div>
		<div>
		<h4>Performance Analysis</h4><p>
			This course taught me how to build scalable software. We learned tools such as UML, software performace engineering, and performance patterns.
		</p></div>
		
		<div>
		<h4>Computer Networks</h4><p>
			Basics of networking focusing on the OSI model. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
		<h4>Computer Architecture</h4> <p>
			In third year I took  three hardware-related courses: Microprocessor interafcting, Digital Systems Engineering, and Computer Architecture. In these courses I learned microprocessor design and architectures, VHDL/Verilog, parallel programming and more. </p>
		</div>
		<div>
		<h4>Microprocessor Interfacing and Embedded Systems</h4><p>
			This is the third installment in a four-course series on computer hardware. Many students find the material dry, but I enjoy it. I however find the material very cool, especially the labs when we worked with FPGA boards.   </p>
		</div>
		<div>
		<h4>Algorithms I</h4><p>
			Much like Data Structures last year this is a standard course. Our professor did a good job of making it interesting, and there are coding assignments that are challenging enough to be fun to do (I used Python).</p>
		</div>
		
		</div>
	
		<p><button type="button"" id="2nd_arrow" class="arrow-button" onclick="expand_collapse('2nd');">&#9654</button><span style="font-size:115%;"><b> Second Year</b></span>
		<div id="2nd" style="display:none;"><p>In second year we got to take some more discipline-specific courses, though there was still a lot of overlap with the Electrical Engineering students.</p>
		<div>			
		<h4>Computing Science for Engineers</h4>
			<p>This course, which was taught in Java and focused on Object Oriented programming, felt like our first real software engineering course. The course included a series of assignments to build an application from the ground up, and I was usually one of the first people to finish them. This inevitably led to a lot of people asking for help fixing their broken code, which improved my debgging skills and ability to work with other peoples' code. </p>  			 
		</div>
		<div>	
		<h4>Fundamentals of Data Structures</h4><p>
			This was a pretty standard data structures course, I don't have too much to say about it. It was the first course the instructor taught, so he wasn't very good. Most people ended up learning the material from online resources.</p></div>
	<div>	
	<h4>Engineering Practice</h4><p>
		In this course we learned about project management through two projects: one to find a good way to transport oil and one to build an Android app to address some sort of disability. Obviously the more interesting of these is the app. The project was only 6 weeks long end-to-end and no team members had any app developent experience, so we chose to use MIT AppInventor for the development. Our app was a voice-operated building navigator which used stored maps to help blind users navigate campus buildings. It was a fun project, but I would have liked to have more time so we could write the app properly and make it dynamically find paths rather than hard-coding them as we did.</p> </div>

		<p><button type="button" id="1st_arrow" class="arrow-button" onclick="expand_collapse('1st');">&#9654</button><span style="font-size:115%;"><b> First Year</b></span>
<div id="1st" style="display:none;"><p>Queen's has a general first year, so we took a variety of courses such as math, physics, chemistry and computer programming. The most interesting were probably Earth Systems Engineering, where we learned about modelling complex systems, and Engineering Practice, where we learned things like modelling and project management.</p></div>
