				<h3>
					About Me
				</h3>
				
				<p>I'm a fourth year Computer Engineering student at Queen's University graduating in Spring 2018. I have completed three software development internships and am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer.</p>
				
				<p>My experience covers mobile and back-end development, operations, control systems and robotics and I am comfortable in C#, Java, C/C++ and Python. If you hadn't guessed from this less-than-stunning website, I'm no UI guru. However, I love to learn and try new things so I'm looking for a position that allows me to do that. Explore my website to learn more!
