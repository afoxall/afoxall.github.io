					About Me
				</h3>
				
				<p>I'm a third year computer engineering student at Queen's University in the Software stream. I have two previous software development internships and am currently looking for a third, either for Summer 2017 or a 12-16 month placement through <a href="quip.html">Queen's Undergraduate Internship Program</a>. </p>
				
				<p>My experience covers operations, back-end development, control systems and robotics and I am comfortable in Java, C/C++, Python and Ruby. I love to learn and try new things, so I'm open to pretty much any internship that allows me to do that. Explore my website to learn more, and feel free to <a href="mailto:alisha.foxall@queensu.ca" >contact me</a> if you have any questions.</p>
