		<p>On the rare occasion that I'm not coding, learning, teaching or sleeping, I try to do things that are very different from those things. </p>
		<p>I love nature, so if there are mountains around I'll probably be climbing them. There aren't too many mountians in Kingston, so I also like reading, playing sports and hanging out with friends. </p>
