		<h5 > May 2015-present</h5>
		<p>I spent this summer working at the <a target="_blank" href="http://me.queensu.ca/Research/Nuclear/RMTL.html">Reactor Materials Testing Laboratory</a>, a nuclear materials research
		facility run by the Queen's Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering. RMTL houses a proton accelerator used to  study the effects of radiation on the 
		mechanical properties of materials.</p>
		<h4>Software & Electrical</h4>
		<p>My main job is to set up temperature controls and data acquisition for a new sample holder. I have written Labview code to, among other things, handle serial communication with two PID 
		controllers, measure current through an Arduino, and control a thermocouple multiplexer. I also designed and populated a PCB for the op amp circuits which allow the Arduino to 
		measure currents and did most of the electrical connections for the sample holder.</p>
		<h4>Design Project</h4>
		<p>Besides my interfacing work I also designed a new apparatus: an array of faraday cups used to image a cross-section of the proton beam. This project presents 
		lots of new challenges from accurately measuring nanocurrents to the complexities of ultra-high vacuum design. I will continue working at RMTL part time all year, 
		building the apparatus I designed and doing interfacing for a new tensile rig. </p>
		
		<p>The best part of this job is how much I'm learning. I have very little supervision, and having just finished my first year of engineering I didn't know much 
		going in. I've had to teach myself everything from Labview itself to serial communications to soldering circuits. It doesn't get much better than getting paid to learn!</p>

		<h5>Summer 2014</h5>
		<p>	I spent last summer working at a bilingual pool and hot tub store helping customers, testing water in the lab and working cash. The position taught me valuable communication 
		and customer service skills, and let me practice my French. </p>
