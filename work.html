		<h3>Queen's University Research Assistant</h3>
		<p>I spent this summer working at the <a href="http://me.queensu.ca/Research/Nuclear/RMTL.html">Reactor Materials Testing Laboratory</a>, a nuclear materials research facility run by the 
		Queen's Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering. RMTL houses a proton accelerator used to  study the effects of radiation on the mechanical properties 
		of materials.</p>
		<p>My main job is to set up temperature controls and data acquisition for a new sample holder. So far I have written Labview code to handle serial communication with two PID controllers, and current 
			detection through an Arduino. I also designed a PCB that holds the op amp circuits which allow the Arduino to measure currents.</p>
		<p>The best part of this job is how much I'm learning. I have very little supervision, and having just finished my first year of engineering I didn't know much going in. I've had to teach myself 
		everything from Labview itself to serial communications to soldering circuits. It doesn't get much better than getting paid to learn!</p>
		<p>Besides my interfacing work I also designed a new apparatus: an array of faraday cups used to image a cross-section of the proton beam. This project presents lots of new challenges 
		from accurately measuring nanocurrents to the complexities of ultra-high vacuum design. I will continue working at RMTL part time all year, building the apparatus I designed and doing interfacing to a new tensile rig. </p>
