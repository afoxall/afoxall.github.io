		<h3> Trend Micro Java Software Developer</h3>
		<h5 > Summer 2016</h5>
		<p>After my second year of univeristy I worked with the Devops team at Trend Micro Deep Security, a cloud and hybrid server security provider in Ottawa, Ontario. Though my official position was "Java Software Developer" I ended up doing way more than that. I did do some java dev, including a major password resuse feature needed for PCI compliance. I also wrote tools and scripts in Ruby, Python and Bash, worked with our Windows and Linux build machines and servers, and set up an ELK stack for data collection and visualization. I became familiar with AWS services like EC2, RDS, S3 and cloudwatch, and designed a new build system to be able to hot-swap documentation in the same product release. </p>
		<p>On the less technical side I learned a lot about Agile development and communicating with everyone from senior developers to technical writers. I also learned firsthand the struggles of collaborating with devs in Taiwan across a 12-hour time difference and language barriers. I got to work with a lot of very smart and talented people, and almost everything I did was new to me so I was always learning. It was a truly amazing experience.</p>

		<h3 >Queen's University Research Assistant</h3>
		<h5 > May 2015-May 2016</h5>
		<p>I spent summer 2015 and my second year working at the <a target="_blank" href="http://me.queensu.ca/Research/Nuclear/RMTL.html">Reactor Materials Testing Laboratory</a>, a nuclear materials research facility run by the Queen's Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering. RMTL houses a proton accelerator used to  study the effects of radiation on the 
		mechanical properties of materials.</p>
		<h4>Software & Electronics</h4>
		<p>My main job was to set up temperature controls and data acquisition for a new sample holder. I wrote Labview code to, among other things, handle serial communication with two PID 
		controllers, measure current through an Arduino, and control a thermocouple multiplexer. I also designed and populated a PCB for the op amp circuits which allow the Arduino to 
		measure currents and did most of the electrical connections for the sample holder.</p>
		<h4>Design Project</h4>
		<p>Besides my interfacing work I also designed and began the manufacturing of a new apparatus: an array of faraday cups used to image a cross-section of the proton beam. This project presents 
		lots of new challenges from accurately measuring nanocurrents to the complexities of ultra-high vacuum design. </p>
		
		<p>The best part of this job is how much I learned. I had very little supervision, and having just finished my first year of engineering I didn't know much going in. I had to teach myself everything from Labview itself to serial communications to soldering circuits. It doesn't get much better than getting paid to learn!</p>

		<h3	>Campbell's Pools Sales Assistant</h3>
		<h5>Summer 2014</h5>
		<p>	I spent a summer working at a bilingual pool and hot tub store helping customers, testing water in the lab and working cash. The position taught me valuable communication 
		and customer service skills, and let me practice my French. </p>
