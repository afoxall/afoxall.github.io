			<h3>
				Queen's Mostly Automated Saiboat Team (MAST) 
			</h3>
			<p> MAST is a student-run design team that, as the name suggests, builds mostly autonomous sailboats for competition. </p>
			<p>I am a member of the software team, the group that writes code to handle issues ranging from basic control to object recognition. 
			This year I was on a sub-team that worked on motor encoder routines. We encountered problems with badly installed hardware 
			and bugs in the old motor control libraries, so what should have taken a few weeks ended up taking all year. </p>

			<h3>First Year</h3>
			<p>Queen's Engineering has a common first year, so everyone takes the same courses. This helps students build a stronger foundation
			 regardless of their discipline of choice, as well as contributing to the strong sense of family present within the whole Faculty.
			 Besides the standard math and science courses, we took a number of interesting courses:	
	<h5>Earth Systems and Engineering</h5>
					This wasn't your average geology class. For example, we learned about modelling fuzzy systems while studying earthquakes, cost-benefit analysis during a highway design case study,
					and environmental ethics through the unanticipated effects of chlorofluorocarbons.   			 
			</p>

					<h5>Engineering Graphics</h5>
					This course taught us to create and interpret computer-generated and hand-drawn technical drawings. I really hope I never have to draw another isometric image without a ruler,
					but the SolidEdge we learned has already been useful in my summer job.
				
				<h5>Engineering Practice</h5>
					This full year course introduced a myriad of engineering skills including technical writing, critical analysis, and system modelling. We then applied these skills 
					in a term-long group project. My project, which is described in more detail below, was the redesign of a mining gate.
