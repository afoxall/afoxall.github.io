			<h3>
				Queen's Mostly Autonomous Saiboat Team (MAST) Software Manager
			</h3>
			<p> MAST is a student-run design team that, as the name suggests, builds mostly autonomous sailboats for competition. </p>
			<p>I am a Co-Manager of the software team, the group that writes code to handle issues ranging from basic control to object recognition. 
			This role is an interesting mix of managerial responsabilities, such as helping team members and task delegation, and technical work. The technical work includes writing, improving and debugging the Arduino code which controls the autonomous sailboat, as well as the occasional electrical troubleshooting and prototyping. Most of the existing code was written by a student a couple years ago, so I have gotten pretty good at navigating poorly styled and documented code.</p>

			<h3>Third Year</h3>

			<p>So far third year has felt a lot more relevant to software engineering than previous years. Almost all of the courses I am taking this term involve some sort of programming.
			
	<h4>Fundamentals of Software Development</h4>
		This course, taught in C++, aims to prepare engineers for real-world software development and includes a major term-long project component. I am the manager for my project team, which means I am responsible for mamking sure work gets done on time and to a certain standard. Our project is called Rowbot, and will be a web-app for rowing club management. We are developing the app using the Wt framework with a MySQL database. Stay tuned for more as the project continues.  			 
			</p>
		<h4>Neural and Genetic Computing</h4>
		This course, which is offered to an interesing mix of computer engineers, computer science, and biology students, covers the basics of neural nets and genetic algorithms for machine learning. It involves programming assignments, which I have been doing in Python, and a group project. My project involves using recurrent neural nets for sentiment analysis. I find this course extremely interesting, and love the feeling when a network you coded from scratch starts learning on its own.

	<h4>Microprocessor Interfacing and Embedded Systems</h4>
		This is the third installment in a four-course series I have yet to mention, which started with Digital Systems and will end next semester with Digital Systems Engineering. It's an interesting set of courses because the first three are all taught by the same professor who is very polarizing. His lectures can be pretty dry, and the tests don't change from year to year so many students put in very little effort. I however find the material very cool, especially the labs when we get to work with FPGA boards. I am looking forward to next term when we implement a complete processor in VHDL, and would certainly be open to doing an internship or my capstone project in this field.  
	
	<h4>Algorithms I</h4>
		Much like Data Structures last year there isn't that much to say about this one. Our pofessor does a good job of making it interesting, and there are coding assignments that are challenging enough to be fun to do (I use Python). The last unit of the course is decided by the students, so that might be fun.

			<h3>Second Year</h3>

			<p>In second year we got to take some more discipline-specific courses, though there was still a lot of overlap with the Electrical Engineering students.
			
	<h4>Computing Science for Engineers</h4>
		This course, which was taught in Java and focused on Object Oriented programming, felt like our first real software engineering course. When the course started I already knew I would be working as a Java developer the following summer, so I put quite a bit of time into mastering the language and material. The course included a series of assignments to build an application from the ground up, and I was usually one of the first people to finish them. This inevitably led to a lot of people asking for help fixing their broken code, which really improved my debgging skills and ability to work with other peoples' code.   			 
			</p>
			
	</div>
	<div class="half">
				
		<h4>Fundamentals of Data Structures</h4>
			This was a pretty standard data structures course, I don't have too much to say about it. It was the first course the instructor taught, so he wasn't all that good, but there are enough resources online that I was able to make up for that.
				
		<h4>Engineering Practice</h4>
			In this course we learned about project management through two projects: one to find a good way to transport oil and one to build an Android app to address some sort of disability. Obviously the more interesting of these is the app. The project was only 6 weeks long end-to-end and no team members had any app developent experience, so we chose to use MIT AppInventor for the development. Our app was a voice-operated building navigator which used stored maps to help blind users navigate campus buildings. It was a fun project, but I would have liked to have more time so we could write the app properly and make it dynamically find paths rather than hard-coding them as we did.

			<h3>First Year</h3>

			<p>Queen's Engineering has a common first year, so everyone takes the same courses. This helps students build a stronger foundation
			 regardless of their discipline of choice.
			 Besides the standard math and science courses, we took a number of interesting courses including:	
	<h4>Earth Systems and Engineering</h4>
					This class taught engineering concepts through the lens of geology. Some of the topics were modelling fuzzy systems while studying earthquakes, cost-benefit analysis during a highway design case study,
					and environmental ethics through the unanticipated effects of chlorofluorocarbons.   			 
			</p>
			
		</div>
		<div class="half">
				
					<h4>Engineering Graphics</h4>
					This course taught us to create and interpret computer-generated and hand-drawn technical drawings. I really hope I never have to draw another isometric image without a ruler,
					but the SolidEdge we learned has already been useful in my summer job.
				
				<h4>Engineering Practice</h4>
					This full year course introduced a myriad of engineering skills including technical writing, critical analysis, and system modelling. We then applied these skills 
					in a term-long group project. My project was the redesign of a mining gate to improve safety in the mining industry.
