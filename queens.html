			<h3>
				Queen's Mostly Automated Saiboat Team (MAST) 
			</h3>
			<p> MAST is a student-run design team that, as the name suggests, builds mostly autonomous sailboats for competition. </p>
			<p>I am a member of the software team, the group that writes code to handle issues ranging from basic control to object recognition. 
			This year I was on a sub-team that worked on motor encoder routines. We encountered problems with badly installed hardware 
			and bugs in the old motor control libraries, so what should have taken a few weeks ended up taking all year. </p>

			<h3>First Year</h3>
			<p>Queen's Engineering has a common first year, so everyone takes the same courses. This helps students build a stronger foundation
			 regardless of their discipline of choice.
			 Besides the standard math and science courses, we took a number of interesting courses including:	
	<h5>Earth Systems and Engineering</h5>
					This class taught engineering concepts through the lens of geology. Some of the topics were modelling fuzzy systems while studying earthquakes, cost-benefit analysis during a highway design case study,
					and environmental ethics through the unanticipated effects of chlorofluorocarbons.   			 
			</p>

					<h5>Engineering Graphics</h5>
					This course taught us to create and interpret computer-generated and hand-drawn technical drawings. I really hope I never have to draw another isometric image without a ruler,
					but the SolidEdge we learned has already been useful in my summer job.
				
				<h5>Engineering Practice</h5>
					This full year course introduced a myriad of engineering skills including technical writing, critical analysis, and system modelling. We then applied these skills 
					in a term-long group project. My project, which is described in more detail below, was the redesign of a mining gate.
